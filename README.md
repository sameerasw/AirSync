## Usage

- **Notification Sync:**

  - Currently, You only can send text to the mac by sharing the text and selecting AirSync from the share sheet target.
  - Once shared, it will be automatically copied to the macOS clipboard.

## Security & Privacy

- **Encryption:** nope, idk how to do, might discover in the future.
- **No Cloud Storage:** Data never leaves your local network.
- **Permissions:** Only requests permissions strictly required for functionality.
- **Open Source:** Reviewable code for full transparency.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

- **Notifications not appearing on Mac?**
  - Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi.
  - Check notification access permission.
  - Restart both apps.

- **Clipboard not syncing?**
  - Make sure the Mac app is running and paired.
  - Clipboard will not share during screen mirroring since scrcpy can handle that anyways.
